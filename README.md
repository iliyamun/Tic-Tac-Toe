# Tic-Tac-Toe Mini-Game

A lightweight but polished Tic-Tac-Toe experience built with Python's `tkinter`.  
The UI focuses on smooth interactions: hover previews, animated status messages,
score tracking, and one-click resets for new rounds.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer (ships with `tkinter` on most installations).  
  On Windows the standard Python installer already includes it.

## Running the Game

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

### Controls

- Click any empty cell to place your mark.
- Hover over a cell to preview your move.
- `New Round` starts over while keeping the score.
- `Reset Score` clears everything for a fresh start.
